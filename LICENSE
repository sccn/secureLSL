SECURE LSL LICENSE

PATENT NOTICE

The algorithms, protocols, and methods embodied in this Software are the
subject of one or more pending patent applications. Patent Pending.

OWNERSHIP

Secure LSL is a proprietary software product created by Seyed Yahya Shirazi
at the Swartz Center for Computational Neuroscience (SCCN), Institute for
Neural Computation (INC), University of California San Diego (UCSD).
While Secure LSL incorporates certain open-source components, the deep
integration of security throughout the codebase, the architectural changes,
and the novel security implementations result in a fundamentally new and
distinct proprietary product.

DEFINITIONS

"Software" means Secure LSL in its entirety, including all source code,
object code, compiled binaries, algorithms, protocols, security
implementations, architectural designs, documentation, tests, benchmarks,
tools, scripts, configurations, build systems, and any related materials
contained in this repository.

"Repository" means the secureLSL repository and all branches, forks, copies,
or reproductions thereof.

"Licensee" means any individual or entity exercising rights under this license.

"Academic Non-Profit Use" means use solely for non-commercial research,
teaching, or educational purposes at an accredited academic institution or
non-profit research organization. This includes academic research that
receives funding or sponsorship from commercial entities, provided that
the research is conducted at and directed by the academic institution, and
the resulting use of the Software does not directly produce commercial
products or services for the funding entity.

"Commercial Use" means any use that is not Academic Non-Profit Use, including
but not limited to: use by for-profit entities, use in commercial products or
services, use that generates revenue, or use in government or industry
research that is not conducted at a non-profit academic institution.

GRANT OF LICENSE FOR ACADEMIC NON-PROFIT USE

grants a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use
and copy the Software solely for Academic Non-Profit Use, provided that:

1. The Software is used exclusively for non-commercial academic research,
   teaching, or educational purposes.
2. Any publications, presentations, or academic works that use or reference
   the Software include proper citation and attribution to the copyright
   holder and the Software.
3. The Software is not distributed or shared outside the Licensee's
   institution, except as reasonably necessary for collaborative academic
   research and only to parties who agree to abide by this license.
4. The Software is not sublicensed, sold, or transferred to any third party.
5. This license notice and all copyright, patent, and proprietary notices are
   retained in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.
6. The Licensee does not use the Software, or information derived directly
   from the Software's source code, to develop competing products or services.

MODIFICATIONS

Modification of the Software is not permitted under any license grant, whether
for Academic Non-Profit Use or otherwise. The sole mechanism for contributing
changes to the Software is by submitting a pull request to the official
Repository, or its successor location as designated by the copyright holder.
Upon review and acceptance by the copyright holder, merged contributions
become part of the Software and are governed by this same license. By
submitting a pull request, the contributor grants the copyright holder an
irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, reproduce,
modify, distribute, and sublicense the contributed changes, and acknowledges
that the contribution will be incorporated under the terms of this license.

   (except through approved pull requests as described under MODIFICATIONS).
2. Removing, altering, or obscuring any proprietary, patent, or copyright
   notices.
3. Claiming authorship or ownership of any part of the Software.
4. Extracting, separating, or isolating any component of the Software for
   independent use outside the context of this Software.
5. Using the Software for benchmarking, comparison, or competitive analysis
   without prior written permission of the copyright holder.
6. Hosting, storing, or making the Software accessible to unauthorized parties.

ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS ON COMMERCIAL USE

Any use of the Software that does not qualify as Academic Non-Profit Use,
including but not limited to for-profit use, commercial use, government use
outside of academic institutions, and non-academic use, requires the express
prior written permission of the copyright holder. Without such permission,
the following are also strictly prohibited:

1. Any Commercial Use of the Software.
2. Distribution, sublicensing, selling, leasing, or transferring the Software
   for non-academic purposes.
3. Incorporating the Software into commercial products, services, or systems.
4. Using the Software to provide services to third parties for compensation.
5. Reverse engineering, disassembling, or decompiling the Software, except
   to the extent such restriction is prohibited by applicable law.
6. Using, implementing, or adapting any patented algorithms, protocols, or
   designs from the Software for commercial purposes.
7. Training machine learning or AI models on the Software for commercial gain.
8. Creating competing implementations based on the Software for commercial
   distribution.

ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF INCORPORATED COMPONENTS

The development of Secure LSL utilized certain open-source libraries and base
code. These incorporated components do not diminish the proprietary nature of
Secure LSL as a complete, integrated product:

Repository create a new proprietary product. To use the original open-source
components, obtain them from their original sources.
